# DarpthWap


Is a program for creating highly optimized depth maps from stereoscopic image pairs. 

DarthWap uses the [OpenCv](http://opencv.org/) library along with [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/) to create optimized settings for depth/disparity map creation. It uses a genetic algorithms to "find" the most ideal settings to use depending on your specific camera and lens. In this way it makes it unnecessary for an artist to know exactly what, of the many settings, should to be or what combination works best.
